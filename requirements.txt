# Notes:
# - On Windows, install the correct torch+cuda wheel first using the PyTorch install selector
#   (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) then run: python -m pip install -r distillist.txt
# - If you don't need GPU, use the cpu-only torch wheel or omit torchaudio/torchvision as needed.
# - "faiss-cpu" is suggested for CPU-based nearest-neighbor search; replace with "faiss-gpu" if
#   you plan to run on GPU and have the matching CUDA runtime.
# - This is a compact starter list; if you want I can produce a trimmed "runtime-only" list or add
#   pinned versions for reproducibility.
