# Distilled minimal requirements for CoMix (hand-curated from piplist.txt)
# Purpose: small, pragmatic set that covers model inference, embedding/search, web UI and data handling.
# Install torque/torch separately if you need a specific CUDA build (see notes below).

# Core ML / embeddings
torch
torchvision
torchaudio
transformers

# Numeric / data
numpy

# OCR packages (optional - install as needed for OCR functionality)
# pytesseract  # Tesseract OCR wrapper (also requires tesseract binary installation)
# easyocr  # Deep learning-based OCR, supports 80+ languages
# paddleocr  # PaddlePaddle OCR (also requires paddlepaddle or paddlepaddle-gpu)
# paddlepaddle  # CPU version for PaddleOCR
# paddlepaddle-gpu  # GPU version for PaddleOCR (requires CUDA)

# Notes:
# - On Windows, install the correct torch+cuda wheel first using the PyTorch install selector
#   (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) then run: python -m pip install -r distillist.txt
# - If you don't need GPU, use the cpu-only torch wheel or omit torchaudio/torchvision as needed.
# - "faiss-cpu" is suggested for CPU-based nearest-neighbor search; replace with "faiss-gpu" if
#   you plan to run on GPU and have the matching CUDA runtime.
# - This is a compact starter list; if you want I can produce a trimmed "runtime-only" list or add
#   pinned versions for reproducibility.
