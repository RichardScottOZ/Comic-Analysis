# Comic-Analysis
Work on looking at analysis of comics with data science

# Survey
- One missing piece in Vision and Language: A Survey on Comics Understanding https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09502v1

Investigating Neural Networks and Transformer Models for Enhanced Comic Decoding - https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-70645-5_10

# Tasks of Interest
- Dialogue transcription
- Therefore, needs a pipeline above that can detect panels


# Pipeline
- See Comix repo
- the code in detections_2000ad are adaptations of the similarly named functions in CoMix/detections to just be inference and not worry about evalutions of models
